ohh yeah.

Look in package.json under scripts. You can define your own, there.

## Terminology
### Action
An action specified without dashes on the commandline. The "pull" in "git pull," for example, is an action.

### Option
An action-modifying option that takes one or more parameters.

### Flag
An action-modifying boolean flag. E.g., "--help" is a flag on the default action.

## Running it
npm run run

npm run build

## To do
1. Consistency check during AssertValidConfiguration() (no duplicate short names, etc)
2. Add NodeJS quick-complete option.
